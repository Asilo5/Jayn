# Jayn's Roti

Todo List is a React practice project, where a user can add a todo, check off the todo, as well as delete the todo.
To make this app I watched [Traversy Media 'React JS Crash Course'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A). The simple styling was done by me.
With this project is where I began to understand what components are and how basic React works on a deeper level.
